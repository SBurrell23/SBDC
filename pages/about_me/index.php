					<p>I'm 24 years old and a graduate of <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/cstop/index.php">Colorado State University</a> with a bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. Currently I work as a software engineer doing mostly full stack web app development for <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.centurylink.com/">Century Link</a>. On this website you will find some programs and and web dev things I've made in my free time. I also use this site to compile photos from my trips and for a fun movie blog I do with my friends.
