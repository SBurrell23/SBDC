				The first game I ever made. Applets got limiting and I decided to give the LWJGL a try. <br>
				Trying to make an entire game from absolutely nothing is hard work, and the 'physics' in game tend to reflect that. <br>
				The game revolves around an alien who has crash landed on earth. He can't find his spaceship, but he sees a cave in the distance. <br>
				He decides to enter it. The cave is dark..

					Duck Dreams was a "The Impossible Game" type game I made after The Cave Is Dark and before Parang. <br>
					But I never got around to finishing audio assets or touching up the main menu. <br>
					I also figured out too late the way that I wrote it made for the game to have some weird framerate issues every now and then that were mildy annoying. <br>
					Regardless, It's very small and pretty entertaining. I finished this game years before the Flappy Bird trend thing ever even existed. <br>
					Too bad I hadn't polished it up and pushed it out.... ($$$)<br>

				Use W,A,S,D to move around the dungeons.<br>
				My small pseudo-random dungeon generator. <br>
				You can't do anything other than run around the dungeons; <br>
				but it's fun to generate them and it was even more fun to write.<br>
